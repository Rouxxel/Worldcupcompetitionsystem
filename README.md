# Worldcupcompetitionsystem
 Final project but from my first semester

I remember doing this assignment with a friend of my course and other peers in my class in my first ever semester in 
university, it was nice but it is so obvious that i have never used Python before and that most of my knowledge was 
self-taught up until this point; for the record i did the Round16Class and the the QfinalsClass, SfinalsClass,
ThirdnFourthClass and FinalClass just copy paste of it but modified for each and i know it is the most unoptimized 
thing you may ever see in your life; coming back to this language after learning Java, C++ and C# is weird
